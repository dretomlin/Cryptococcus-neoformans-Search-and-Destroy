DONE: make lda topics
-they probably work
-if massive error, they do not

TO DO:
-convert set of documents into dataframe (each document has a column for each topic
	as well as a column for label)
-apply lda topics to new documents

-predict based on decision tree or SVM

-clean data (http should not be a predictive word)
